### Graphs in Python: Representing Graphs in Code

This folder contains implementations used in the article ["Graphs in Python: Representing Graphs in Code"](https://stackabuse.com/graphs-in-python-representing-graphs-in-code/):
- `edge_list_graph_basic.py`
- `adj_matrix_graph_basic.py`
- `adj_list_graph_basic.py`

Those are basic implementations we've used for illustrative purposes in the mentioned article. You can find more advanced implementations in the `advanced_implementations` folder.

The main difference between simple and advanced implementations for casual user is that you can arbitratily name nodes in advanced implementation.
